# -IR-Controlled-TRIAC-Dimmer-Circuit

The goal of it is to control light intensity of any AC appliances. When IR remote is pressed, it can increase light intensity, which is being operated in 4 steps. For this, instead of micro controller, we have used decade counter for timing issues. Triac was used for minimizing or maximizing AC power with zero crossing method.
